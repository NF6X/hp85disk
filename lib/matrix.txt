A "minor" is the determinant of the square matrix formed by deleting one row and one column from some larger square matrix

(–1)i+j * Mi,j  =  Ai,j

So the Minor (Mi,j) and  Cofactor (Ai,j)  are the same except for sign


Optimize - look for zeros as the products are 0 when doing determinats
