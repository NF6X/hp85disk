## Jay Hamlin V2 circuit board design 
  * Jay start work on this design about a year ago in 2019 
    * I only recently got around to updating my code to work with the new design. I am thankful of his contribution as it will allow more people to use build this project. After several exchanges Jay added GPIB drivers, New Parallel Poll circuit, and an I2C connector -for Real Time clock and and a future optional display. The GPIB drivers and and updated Parallel Poll circuit should allow using the drive with more devices attached on the GPIB BUS.
  * [Release folder has Eagle design files, PDF renderings and images of the board](releases)
    * Note: Eagle design software is (C) by Autodesk
